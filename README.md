# hello-world
This repository is my first step on Github,maybe just to store something I wrote.
Last time when I attend the interview of Dian,interviewer needs me to learn how to use the Git,however,I thought I was too tired,so I give it up.
Now,I want to change.
And this summer vacation,I wanna learn and use it perfectly.
